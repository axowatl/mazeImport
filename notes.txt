TODO
----
Reorder buttons, 'Build Maze' should always be in same place
Add other algorithms
Make config area scrollable
Check all info msgs still make sense (include key codes and ctrl-shift)
Create Mask -> Edit Mask if applicable
Validate masks before saving
Add arrows to solution path
Split maze types into separate files
TO DO comments in both projects
Download as SVG


Bugs
----
Some algorithms break if a mask is applied (Square, Sidewinder, mask TL corner) and others generate invalid mazes
Circle maze breaks if center masked out
Resizing window breaks maze for certain states
Thin white lines between squares in distance map
Solution path does not reach exit walls
